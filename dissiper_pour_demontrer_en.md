# Note to the reader

This document presents a **speculative analogy** between three fundamental results: Gödel's incompleteness, Landauer's principle, and Prigogine's dissipative structures.

The goal is to formulate a conjecture clearly enough that it can be evaluated, criticized, and potentially refuted. This is not a theorem. This is not a proof. This is an invitation to think.

# 1. Three results

**Gödel (1931)**: Any consistent formal system capable of expressing arithmetic contains true statements that cannot be proven within the system.

**Landauer (1961)**: Erasing one bit of information requires at least $k_B T \ln 2$ joules of energy.

**Prigogine (1977)**: Open systems can maintain internal order by exporting entropy to their environment.

# 2. An observation

These three results share a common theme: **closure has costs**.

- A closed formal system (no external axioms) → incompleteness
- A closed computational process (no energy dissipation) → reversibility constraints
- A closed physical system (no entropy export) → disorder increases

---

# 3. The conjecture

> Pathologies of formal systems (incompleteness, undecidability, paradoxes) may be understood as manifestations of a **dissipation deficit**.

More precisely: when a formal system creates self-referential loops (as in Gödel's construction), those loops have no "exit" — no way to export the problematic information to an external level.

If a system could "dissipate" self-reference — export it to a meta-level, anchor it in physical reality — it might avoid the blockage.

---

# 4. What this would mean (if true)

1. **Stable mathematics requires physicality**: Not just in implementation, but structurally. A mathematical community that forgets, prunes, and interacts with reality can remain coherent. An isolated formal system cannot.

2. **Incompleteness is the price of openness**: Tarski's hierarchy of metalanguages is infinite. But if each level "crystallizes" properly before promoting to the next, the system remains usable.

3. **Forgetting is necessary for coherence**: Systems that preserve everything (perfect memory, no pruning) accumulate contradictions.

---


# 6. What would be needed to test this

1. **Formalize "logical dissipation"**: Define what it means for a formal system to dissipate. This is not currently well-defined.

2. **Exhibit examples**: Find formal systems that are "dissipative" in some sense and show they avoid certain pathologies.

3. **Find counterexamples**: Identify systems that should be pathological according to the conjecture but are not (or vice versa).

4. **Connect to existing work**: There may be relevant results in proof theory, type theory, or computational complexity that relate to this.

# 7. Related ideas

- **Chaitin's Omega**: Algorithmic information theory connects randomness and incompleteness. Is there an energy interpretation?

- **Friston's Free Energy Principle**: Biological systems minimize variational free energy. This is already a thermodynamic-Bayesian bridge.

- **Wheeler's "It from Bit"**: Information as fundamental. If information is physical, are logical constraints also physical?

# 8. Conclusion

This note presents a conjecture, not a result:

> **A formal system can only maintain coherence if it is open, dissipative, and recursive.**

The conjecture may be wrong. But if it's wrong, understanding *why* it's wrong might be illuminating.

If it's right — even partially — it would suggest that the foundations of mathematics are not purely abstract, but are constrained by something like thermodynamics.
