# BEDS: Bayesian Emergent Dissipative Structures

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1127115494.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18156131)

**BEDS** is a theoretical framework proposing that learning—across physical, biological, and computational systems—is fundamentally the conversion of flux into structure through entropy export. Building on Prigogine's dissipative structures and Bayesian inference, BEDS establishes that sustainable learning systems must follow a recursive pattern where crystallized knowledge becomes the prior for the next level of emergence. The framework derives mathematical constants (e, π, φ) as fixed points of inference, proposes a connection between Gödel's incompleteness and thermodynamic constraints, and demonstrates a P2P architecture achieving 10⁶× energy efficiency over existing distributed systems.
